# 100 Days Of Code - Log




### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started doing the FCC JavaScript Calculator. Did make simple HTML/CSS calculator. Started implementing some JS and found a great
extension which makes writing that JS app alot simplier.

**Thoughts** Initial idea is to make a calculator look-a-like thing in HTML/CSS .When it kind-of looks fairly decent, I will start implementing JS.

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added Google analytics to my webpage.After that trying to work on my
JS calculator. I was wondering why I couldn't save my pen. Guessed that it saved automatically and no changes made then...
Closed my codepen and when I came back all the progress was lost... I realized that I was not logged in. So yeah, a bit
work lost today :/

**Thoughts** Thought adding analytics would be harder.. :D
Stuck on adding Math.eval() into my html element (".valueScreen").html(math.eval("1+2")) does not return me that, will keep trying to solve that
