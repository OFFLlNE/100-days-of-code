# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: February 3 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Game movement fixed + refactoring

**Thoughts**
Figured out the Game movement bug. Since it was mapping the rows, what happenes was that it moved down and then the map went on to the next row and saw there character is there and then moved again. So basically whenever it was moving down it did it until it stopped moving down. The fix was to take out the movement function from the map function and we were cruising!
Cleaned up the Game code a bit and tried to make it short.
Also added some playerHealth, money and wave states.

### Day 12: February 2 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Trying to add Tests for Calculator
Working on Game movement

**Thoughts**
Most time spent on trying to get the Game moving. Almost works perfectly, but for some reason does 3 movement actions in a row when moving down. Need to figure out why this is happening. Quite difficult

### Day 11: February 1 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Trying to add Tests for Calculator
Adding unique key to element mapping in Game

**Thoughts**
Most time was spent on trying to get the tests running. I wrote a basic addition test, but couldn't get the yarn test to run. Need to read up on how to setup jest tests properly.
Quite happy that I found a way to get the index for a map in the Game, just quick documentation check and I was done with something I thought will be difficult to figure out

### Day 10: January 31 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Movement function in Game
Started reading about tests for Calc

**Thoughts**
In the console log I got the whole path movement done for the Game I am building. But I cannot get the game field UI to update - I guess I got to deal with state here, need to read up more on it. Also facing the issue where my React mapping key value is repeating all over the place.
Calculator did not get too much attention today, just started reading the jest docs on how to get started with the tests.

### Day 9: January 30 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Working on the Tower Defense JS Project
Some styling to the Calculator

**Thoughts**
Calculator starting to look pretty sleep - quite happy about that. I am starting to put more time towards the game (80-20) but would love to have a very nice calculator component finished at some point.
Game is quite interesting project, I would be very happy if I can finish it by the end of 100 days, we shall see! Today I was mostly working on trying to find pathfinding algorithms and tried to understand how can I implement them in my JS grid. But then it sparked that I do not need pathfinder alorithm with a fixed game path. So I just hardcoded the coordinates of all moves you can take on the path.

### Day 8: January 29 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Got Calculator fully functional with my buttons
Later in the day started small Game project

**Thoughts**
Finally, on the last second I figured out how to fix one of the last bugs I managed to find. Otherwise this is now fully functional. At some point I went out to see how there are some other React Hooks calculators done, but they had a bug as well so I just tried and continued brainstorming on my own Calculator. Pretty happy with it.
Next up Styles, Tests and proper TypeScript return types

Wanted to see if I will be able to create a tower defense game in JS. A little scared of the pathfinding and collision detection, but I will give it a try!

### Day 7: January 28 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Rewrote most of the functions to be better organized in Calculator

**Thoughts**
Again, I am almost there. It seems to work fine when I end up my math with the =. But if I chain multiple operations together as in 2*2*2 then it breaks somewhere. Really hoping to figure it out tomorrow so I can get on with styling + adding tests

### Day 6: January 27 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Continued on calculation logic in the Calculator

**Thoughts**
There are some edge cases coming in which are sometimes hard to understand why they appear. Code is starting to feel more like spaghetti code :(. Got to try to clean it up tomorrow or at least get it fully functional first

### Day 5: January 26 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Tried adding the math logic to Calculator.

**Thoughts**
It was a struggle. I think I tried to complete too big of a chunk of logic. So in the end I started going bit by bit. First just adding numbers together and clearing the input field when symbol is clicked.
From there I now need to add the logic again when a symbol is being clicked

### Day 4: January 25 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Read the React Hooks documentation
Added first hook into Calculator

**Thoughts**
Hooks turn out to be pretty easy to understand, I am surprised I couldn't understand them before.
Also added my first hook to the calculator which just changes the input based on which button I click. From there I now need to actually create a logic to store that input for longer etc.

### Day 3: January 24 2021

**Today's Progress**:

- Calculator:
  -- Added Sass
  -- Created CalculatorButton component
  -- Mapping all buttons with the button component
- Reading about React Hooks

**Thoughts** Hooks been a around for quite some time now, but I am finally taking the time to actually read the documentation about them and to properly understand it. So far the useState one seems pretty straightforward. After that I believe I can finally add some button functionalities to my calculator

### Day 2: January 23 2021

**Today's Progress**: Starting to build a Calculator

**Thoughts** I was stuck trying to figure out why my arrow function requires a return after adding JSX.Element as return type in Calculator. As it was very late at night when I found the time to do that daily coding hour I was a little exhausted and just wrote the base for the Calculator and the action plan what needs to come next.
Also I believe I need to read up on TypeScript itself and finally understand how Hooks work. So might dedicate some time for that

### Day 1: January 22 2021

**Today's Progress**: Trying to set up React app from scratch which would use TypeScript

**Thoughts** A little more difficult that I imagined. I tried to use the tutorials only without reading any documatation.
I also wanted to avoid CRA, so I could try it all myself. Next time I might try to invest more time into documatations

### Attempt at it in 2017!

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started doing the FCC JavaScript Calculator. Did make simple HTML/CSS calculator. Started implementing some JS and found a great
extension which makes writing that JS app alot simplier.

**Thoughts** Initial idea is to make a calculator look-a-like thing in HTML/CSS .When it kind-of looks fairly decent, I will start implementing JS.

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added Google analytics to my webpage.After that trying to work on my
JS calculator. I was wondering why I couldn't save my pen. Guessed that it saved automatically and no changes made then...
Closed my codepen and when I came back all the progress was lost... I realized that I was not logged in. So yeah, a bit
work lost today :/

**Thoughts** Thought adding analytics would be harder.. :D
Stuck on adding Math.eval() into my html element (".valueScreen").html(math.eval("1+2")) does not return me that, will keep trying to solve that
